=== Osnove vej in združevanja

Pojdimo skozi enostaven primer vej in združevanja s potekom dela, ki ga morda uporabljate v realnem svetu.
Sledili boste tem korakom:

. Naredite delo na spletni strani.
. Ustvarite vejo za novo zgodbo na kateri delate.
. Naredite nekaj dela na tej veji.

V tej fazi boste prejeli klic, da je druga težava kritična in potrebujete sprotni popravek.
Naredili boste sledeče:

. Preklopili na vašo produkcijsko vejo.
. Ustvarili vejo, da dodate sprotni popravek.
. Ko je testiran, združite vejo sprotnega popravka in potisnete v produkcijo.
. Preklopite nazaj na vašo prvotno zgodbo in nadaljujete delo.

==== Osnove vej

(((branches, basic workflow)))
Najprej recimo, da delate na vašem projektu in imate že nekaj pošiljanj.

.A simple commit history
image::images/basic-branching-1.png[A simple commit history.]

Odločili ste se, da boste delali na težavi #53 v kateremkoli težavam-sledilnem sistemu, ki ga vaše podjetje uporablja.
Da ustvarite vejo in nanjo preklopite istočasno, lahko poženete ukaz `git checkout` s stikalom `-b`:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout -b iss53
Switched to a new branch "iss53"
----

To je bližnjica za:

[source,console]
----
$ git branch iss53
$ git checkout iss53
----

.Creating a new branch pointer
image::images/basic-branching-2.png[Creating a new branch pointer.]

Delate na vaši spletni strani in naredite nekaj pošiljanj.
Da to naredite premakne vejo `iss53` naprej, ker ste jo izpisali (to pomeni, vaš `HEAD` kaže nanjo):

[source,console]
----
$ vim index.html
$ git commit -a -m 'added a new footer [issue 53]'
----

.The iss53 branch has moved forward with your work
image::images/basic-branching-3.png[The iss53 branch has moved forward with your work.]

Sedaj dobite klic, da je težava s spletno stranjo in jo potrebujete takoj popraviti.
Z Git-om vam ni treba nalagati vašega popravka skupaj s spremembami `iss53`, ki ste jih naredili in ni vam treba vložiti veliko napora v povračanje teh sprememb preden lahko delate na uporabi vašega popravka na to, kar je v produkciji.
Vse kar morate narediti je preklopiti nazaj na vašo vejo `master`.

Vendar preden to naredite, pomnite, da če ima vaš delovni direktorij ali vmesna faza neposlane spremembe, ki so v konfliktu z vejo, ki jo izpisujete, vam Git ne bo dovolil preklopiti vej.
Najbolje je imeti čisto delovno stanje, ko preklapljate veje.
Obstajajo načini, da se temu izognete (v glavnem, skrivanje in pošiljanje sprememb), kar bomo pokrili kasneje v <<_git_stashing>>.
Za sedaj predpostavimo, da ste poslali vse vaše spremembe, tako da lahko preklopite nazaj na vašo vejo master:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
----

Na tej točki vaš delovni direktorij projekta je točno tak, kakor je bil preden, ste pričeli delati na težavi #53 in sedaj se lahko skoncentrirate na vaš sprotni popravek.
To je pomembna točka za zapomniti: ko preklapljate veje, Git ponastavi vaš delovni direktorij, da izgleda kot je, ko ste zadnjič poslali na to vejo.
Doda, odstrani in spremeni datoteke avtomatično, da zagotovi, da je vaša delovna kopija taka, kot je izgledala veja na vašem zadnjem pošiljanju vanjo.

Naslednje imate za narediti sprotni popravek.
Ustvarimo vejo sprotnega popravka na kateri delate dokler ni končan:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout -b hotfix
Switched to a new branch 'hotfix'
$ vim index.html
$ git commit -a -m 'fixed the broken email address'
[hotfix 1fb7853] fixed the broken email address
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
----

.Hotfix branch based on `master`
image::images/basic-branching-4.png[Hotfix branch based on `master`.]

Lahko poženete vaše teste, zagotovite, da je sprotni popravek, kar želite in ga združite nazaj v vašo vejo master, da naložite v produkcijo.
To naredite z ukazom `git merge`:(((git commands, merge)))

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout master
$ git merge hotfix
Updating f42c576..3a0874c
Fast-forward
 index.html | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
----

Opazili bste frazo ``fast-forward'' v tem združevanju.
Ker je bilo pošiljanje, kamor kaže veja, ki ste jo združili, direktno gorvodno pošiljanja na katerem ste, Git enostavno premakne kazalec naprej.
Da dodamo frazo na drug način, kot poskušate združiti eno pošiljanje z drugim, se to lahko doseže 
To phrase that another way, when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit's history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together – this is called a ``fast-forward.''

Your change is now in the snapshot of the commit pointed to by the `master` branch, and you can deploy the fix.

.`master` is fast-forwarded to `hotfix`
image::images/basic-branching-5.png[`master` is fast-forwarded to `hotfix`.]

After your super-important fix is deployed, you're ready to switch back to the work you were doing before you were interrupted.
However, first you'll delete the `hotfix` branch, because you no longer need it – the `master` branch points at the same place.
You can delete it with the `-d` option to `git branch`:

[source,console]
----
$ git branch -d hotfix
Deleted branch hotfix (3a0874c).
----

Now you can switch back to your work-in-progress branch on issue #53 and continue working on it.

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout iss53
Switched to branch "iss53"
$ vim index.html
$ git commit -a -m 'finished the new footer [issue 53]'
[iss53 ad82d7a] finished the new footer [issue 53]
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
----

.Work continues on `iss53`
image::images/basic-branching-6.png[Work continues on `iss53`.]

It's worth noting here that the work you did in your `hotfix` branch is not contained in the files in your `iss53` branch.
If you need to pull it in, you can merge your `master` branch into your `iss53` branch by running `git merge master`, or you can wait to integrate those changes until you decide to pull the `iss53` branch back into `master` later.

[[_basic_merging]]
==== Basic Merging

(((branches, merging)))(((merging)))
Suppose you've decided that your issue #53 work is complete and ready to be merged into your `master` branch.
In order to do that, you'll merge in your `iss53` branch, much like you merged in your `hotfix` branch earlier.
All you have to do is check out the branch you wish to merge into and then run the `git merge` command:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$ git merge iss53
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
index.html |    1 +
1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
----

This looks a bit different than the `hotfix` merge you did earlier.
In this case, your development history has diverged from some older point.
Because the commit on the branch you're on isn't a direct ancestor of the branch you're merging in, Git has to do some work.
In this case, Git does a simple three-way merge, using the two snapshots pointed to by the branch tips and the common ancestor of the two.

.Three snapshots used in a typical merge
image::images/basic-merging-1.png[Three snapshots used in a typical merge.]

Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it.
This is referred to as a merge commit, and is special in that it has more than one parent.

.A merge commit
image::images/basic-merging-2.png[A merge commit.]

It's worth pointing out that Git determines the best common ancestor to use for its merge base; this is different than older tools like CVS or Subversion (before version 1.5), where the developer doing the merge had to figure out the best merge base for themselves.
This makes merging a heck of a lot easier in Git than in these other systems.

Now that your work is merged in, you have no further need for the `iss53` branch.
You can close the ticket in your ticket-tracking system, and delete the branch:

[source,console]
----
$ git branch -d iss53
----

[[_basic_merge_conflicts]]
==== Basic Merge Conflicts

(((merging, conflicts)))
Occasionally, this process doesn't go smoothly.
If you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you're merging together, Git won't be able to merge them cleanly.
If your fix for issue #53 modified the same part of a file as the `hotfix`, you'll get a merge conflict that looks something like this:

[source,console]
----
$ git merge iss53
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
----

Git hasn't automatically created a new merge commit.
It has paused the process while you resolve the conflict.
If you want to see which files are unmerged at any point after a merge conflict, you can run `git status`:

[source,console]
----
$ git status
On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

    both modified:      index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
----

Anything that has merge conflicts and hasn't been resolved is listed as unmerged.
Git adds standard conflict-resolution markers to the files that have conflicts, so you can open them manually and resolve those conflicts.
Your file contains a section that looks something like this:

[source,html]
----
<<<<<<< HEAD:index.html
<div id="footer">contact : email.support@github.com</div>
=======
<div id="footer">
 please contact us at support@github.com
</div>
>>>>>>> iss53:index.html
----

This means the version in `HEAD` (your `master` branch, because that was what you had checked out when you ran your merge command) is the top part of that block (everything above the `=======`), while the version in your `iss53` branch looks like everything in the bottom part.
In order to resolve the conflict, you have to either choose one side or the other or merge the contents yourself.
For instance, you might resolve this conflict by replacing the entire block with this:

[source,html]
----
<div id="footer">
please contact us at email.support@github.com
</div>
----

This resolution has a little of each section, and the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` lines have been completely removed.
After you've resolved each of these sections in each conflicted file, run `git add` on each file to mark it as resolved.
Staging the file marks it as resolved in Git.

If you want to use a graphical tool to resolve these issues, you can run `git mergetool`, which fires up an appropriate visual merge tool and walks you through the conflicts:(((git commands, mergetool)))

[source,console]
----
$ git mergetool

This message is displayed because 'merge.tool' is not configured.
See 'git mergetool --tool-help' or 'git help config' for more details.
'git mergetool' will now attempt to use one of the following tools:
opendiff kdiff3 tkdiff xxdiff meld tortoisemerge gvimdiff diffuse diffmerge ecmerge p4merge araxis bc3 codecompare vimdiff emerge
Merging:
index.html

Normal merge conflict for 'index.html':
  {local}: modified file
  {remote}: modified file
Hit return to start merge resolution tool (opendiff):
----

If you want to use a merge tool other than the default (Git chose `opendiff` in this case because the command was run on a Mac), you can see all the supported tools listed at the top after ``one of the following tools.''
Just type the name of the tool you'd rather use.

[NOTE]
====
If you need more advanced tools for resolving tricky merge conflicts, we cover more on merging in <<_advanced_merging>>.
====

After you exit the merge tool, Git asks you if the merge was successful.
If you tell the script that it was, it stages the file to mark it as resolved for you.
You can run `git status` again to verify that all conflicts have been resolved:

[source,console]
----
$ git status
On branch master
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

    modified:   index.html
----

If you're happy with that, and you verify that everything that had conflicts has been staged, you can type `git commit` to finalize the merge commit.
The commit message by default looks something like this:

[source,console]
----
Merge branch 'iss53'

Conflicts:
    index.html
#
# It looks like you may be committing a merge.
# If this is not correct, please remove the file
#	.git/MERGE_HEAD
# and try again.


# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
# All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   index.html
#
----

You can modify that message with details about how you resolved the merge if you think it would be helpful to others looking at this merge in the future – why you did what you did, if it's not obvious.
